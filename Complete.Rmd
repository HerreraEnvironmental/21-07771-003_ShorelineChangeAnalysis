TODO: SET ALL NUMBERS TO SIG FIGS

# Overview

This analysis aims to characterize approximately 25 years of shoreline profile transect data, provided by NANOOS (Northwest Assocation of Networked Ocean Observing Systems).
Using this data combined with area expertise, the relevant coastal areas have been delineated into reaches.

The raw data consists of approximately 4500 individual profiles across 54 coastal sites in Washington and Oregon.
The profiles are in x y z format (Easting Northing elevation).The naming convention is prof_X\_ssYY.out where prof is short for profile, X is the profile number, ss is a season code (e.g. f = fall) and YY is the year, in the format of the last two digits (e.g. "98" is 1998", "00" is 2000, "08" is 2008, etc).

Quite a few profiles are null (empty) and have been removed and noted.
See the "Explore Profiles" section for more information.

A small portion of the profiles had non-conforming filenames: "BigE06", "beachface", etc.
These files do not represent a large percentage of the files and have not been included in the analysis.

Profiles 42 - 47 are in Oregon, and so have been excluded from much of the analysis.

*Geographically speaking, profiles do not proceed sequentially.*

### Metadata

The vertical datum is NAVD88.
The horizontal is WA State Plane South.

## The "BasePoint" reference line and Euclidean distance as an accretion/erosion proxy

In order to quantify shoreline change, an arbitrary "BasePoint" reference line, approximately parallel to the shoreline, was drawn at a reasonable distance from the profiles so as to be unaffected by temporal change.

The NANOOS profiles are perpendicular to this BasePoint, allowing for a reference against which to calculate spatial change.

In order to visualize this concept, the images below display 1) a simplified selection of profiles (plotted in black) compared to the BasePoint (plotted in red) and 2) an individual profile (plotted in black) and its BasePoint (plotted in red).

```{r profiles_BasePoint, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
source("scripts/profiles_and_BasePoint.R")
print(all.basepoint.plot)
print(single.basepoint.plot)
```

![Profile 6 plotted in x y format, compared to a fixed inland basepoint.](figures/pdf_plots/profile6_basepoint.png)

![Profiles 6 - 9 plotted in x y format, compared to a fixed inland basepoint.](figures/pdf_plots/multipleprofiles_basepoint.png)

Using Euclidean distance, migrations of the transects over time as compared to the BasePoint act as proxies for accretion and erosion. 

The midpoint of each transect is calculated to determine a single comparative point using the midpoint formula pictured below.

$$\left(\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1+y_2}{2}\right)$$

The Euclidean distance between the midpoint and the fixed BasePoint is calculated for each transect and each year, resulting in an increasing or decreasing Euclidean distance. This distances correlates to an accreting or eroding transect.

$$d=\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}$$

|                               |           |
|-------------------------------|-----------|
| Increasing Euclidean distance | Accretion |
| Decreasing Euclidean distance | Erosion   |

## Determining significance in accretion and erosion classifications for profiles. 

Apply the midpoint formula and distance formula to each transect/BasePoint pair, and plot the movement of the midpoint over time. This produces an x:y, distance:time relationship to which a linear model can be fitted. Once the linear model has been produced, the slope and p values can be extracted and used as respective indicators of transect characterization and significance. 

If the slope of a given distance:time relationship is positive, this indicates the distance between the transect midpoint and the BasePoint is increasing and the shoreline is accreting. If the slope is negative, the distance is decreasing and the shoreline is eroding. Linear models with a pvalue < 0.05 are considered significant.

profile.pattern <- "prof" ## Adjust this to see specific profiles.

## Assign status to each profile according to linear regression equation details.

Below is a table with the relevant results of each profile's linear regression over time, including pvalues (less than 0.05 indicates a significant relationship), rsquared values (indicitive of how good the fit of the regression is) and the Pearson correlation (how closely are time and euclidean distance, or x and y, related).

## Comparison of results to Washington Coastal Erosion Hazard Assessment (WCEHA)

The WCEHA (<https://waecy.maps.arcgis.com/apps/View/index.html?appid=389d0a3ce642485db912d4a416a56e25>) is a second database that can be used as a comparison to the results from the NANOOS profiles.

```{r WCEHA_validation, echo=FALSE}
source("scripts/WCEHA_validation.R")
knitr::kable(all.data, caption = "Comparison with WCEHA data") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(fixed_thead = T) %>%
  row_spec(which(all.data$conflict == "flag"), bold = T, color = "white",
           background = "tomato")

```

## Some notes on comparisons between the NANOOS analysis and the WCEHA data

The profiles that don't match up with WCEHA data are:

-   Profiles 14 and 15 at the North Jetty

    -   These two profiles fall into a small "erosion" classification according to the WCEHA data, and are located at a highly dynamic shoreline zone.

-   Profiles 16 and 17 (Westport Light North and South)

    -   Both profiles' NANOOS classification of "accretion" conflicts with the WCEHA classifcation of "erosion". It's true that Westport North is eroding overall, but WCEHA contains data from 2006 - 2019, and NANOOS contains data from 1997 - 2022. NANOOS incorporates the geomorphologically impactful Army Corp nourishment more holistically. Both of the Westport profiles were "non significant" accretion, and speaks to the volatility of shorelines on the peninsula.

-   Profile 26, one of the Leadbetter Point profiles, falls into a very small 'erosion' window on the WCEHA dataset on an otherwise accreting peninsula. This slice of land is also the site of vegetation clearance for snowy plover habitat, potentially complicating the aerial-imagery-based WCEHA designation.

-   Profile 50, located at Seaview. NANOOS indicates erosion and WCEHA indicates accretion, however, the NANOOS data is non significant.

-   Profile 51, slightly north of the North Head lighthouse. NANOOS indicates accretion and WCEHA indicates erosion, however, this is also a non-significant data point from the NANOOS profile. Additionally, this point is influenced by the presence of the North Head outcropping.
    
    
## Quartile Points and Change Rates

Using the midpoint of each transect selects a single point as a proxy for erosion through time.
This can obscure the inherent variation in the collection of profiles.

The profiles have roughly linear relationships due to the geographic layout: in general, a change in x (moving along the Easting plane) will result in a *roughly* equal change in y (the Northing plane).
Therefore, a linear regression can be applied to the x and y variables of each profile to obtain a line proxy rather than a single point.

Below are images of a single profile and year to see the applied linear regression. In the first image, a linear regression is overlaid onto a single profile, and in the second, the linear quartiles of the regression are added. Note that in the second image, the red "BasePoint" has been included to visualize distance. 

These quartiles are labeled "minimum", "quartile1", "median", "quartile3", and "maximum" in accordance with standard boxplot parameters, although they are calculated using *only distance* and not boxplot delineations.

```{r single_linear_quartiles, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
profile.pattern <- "prof_16"
year.pattern <- "00"

source("scripts/single_linear_quartiles.R")
single.linear.plot + single.quartiles.plot
```

![Distance-calculated quartiles of profile 16 in the year 2000, including the fixed BasePoint.](figures/pdf_plots/profile16_quartiles.png)

Characterizing the profiles with more points allows for a more detailed look at erosion and accretion rates.

Each quartile's Euclidean movement is tracked over time, using the same calculations as the midpoint proxy used above. The rate of change is then calculated for each quartile of each profile, using a standard rate of change calculation between each year:

$$\frac{EucDist_2 - EucDist_1}{EucDist_1} \times 100\%$$
EucDist2 is the more recent year, and EucDist1 is the older year. This is calculated for each set of years from 1997 - 2022. 
For each profile, the average rate of change (ROC) between all quartiles is taken. 

```{r rates_of_change, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
profile.pattern <- "prof"
source("scripts/rates_of_change.R")

## Clustering profiles into geographic reaches.

Using the Euclidean distance between the profile midpoint and the 

This analysis applies unsupervised clustering, as we want are inputting unlabeled data without training.
Relevant types of unsupervised clustering are k-means clustering and hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HCA).

Pure kmeans requires some advance knowledge of the number of clusters k, while HCA seeks to build a hierarchy of clusters without a predetermined k.

Because we are trying to determine the sub reaches, we will use HCA for this analysis.
The number of classes is not specified in advance; hierarchical clustering will determine that.

Our variables are distance to baseline (euclidean midpoint movement over time, aka erosion and accretion), and year.

HCA Approach 1.
Create a distance matrix that computes and returns the distance between rows.
2.
Start with every point in its own cluster and compare distances.
3.
Merge the two points that are closest to each other based on "distance" (distance method is variable), from the calculated distance matrix in step 1.
This removes one cluster.
This also corresponds to the first height of the luster dendogram.
- Measure cluster distance by single linkage: compute minimum distance before merging.
- "Single" is the default distance measure but may not be the most effective.
- "Single" also falls under the umbrella of nearest neighbor method, which builds branches off of smallest distances.
4.
Recalculate all distances with the new number of clusters and continue to combine.
5.
Continue this until all clusters have been merged.
6.
Create a dendogram using the history of the point combination, which shows the sequence of combinations of the clusters.
The distances of merge between clusters, called heights, are illustrated on the y-axis.
